# 42_Getnextline
get_next_line() is a function that, when called, returns one line of a file descriptor. When used repeatedly, it will allow you to read the entire file pointed to by the file descriptor, line by line, until the end. The buffer size can be modified when compiling the function.<br>

The bonus part allows you to read various file descriptors at a time.<br>

With this project I learnt what static variables are and how to use them.
